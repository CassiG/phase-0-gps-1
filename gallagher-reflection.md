## GPS 1.1 Reflections

1. What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

I understood the basic concept of a Pull Request, but I was still confused on how to pull changes, and what branch you were supposed to pull changes to on your local repository once a pull request was merged. 

2. What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

This session helped clarify the above issue for me, because going through a pull request with two people showed me how it would look going through this process on a team - which helped clarify how each step works. 

3. What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

I asked and was curious about which branch you're supposed to pull changes down to when you're trying to pull/fetch the most up-to-date changes on a github repository 

4. What still confuses you about Git?

Merging conflicts still confuses me just a bit, like when you see a conflict or if you're working on a team who is supposed to resolve the conflict. 

5. How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

My first expirience was great. My pairing partner, Lindsay was great to communicate with and I thought we did a good job sharing knowlege/helping out back and forth. Our Guide Helin was great as well and did a great job of jumping in only when we seemed really confused, and let us work things out when we seemed to be on the right track.
